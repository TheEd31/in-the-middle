    <h1>MS Singers</h1>
    <h2 class="author">By Florrie ('32), and Grace ('32)</h2>
    <p>
Middle School Singers (MS singers) is an amazing chance to learn, connect, and have fun if you enjoy singing, performing, or just want to try something new! Here you can learn about MS singers and what they do.
The first step to joining MS singers is to sign up for an audition spot and confirm with Ms. Hardison. Then, on the day of the audition, arrive a bit early and get ready to sing. Then you will be called in to sing some warm-ups, and Ms Hardison will find out if you are an alto (lower voice) or a soprano (higher voice). CONGRATULATIONS! You now part of Middle School Singers! 
One of the songs that the MS singers will be singing this year is ‘Northern Lights’ which is about the beauty of the phenomenon aurora borealis. The song will take you on a journey to the North Pole, where you can see ‘lights flicker, lights flash’ in delightful arrays of color and light. Another song that the Middle School Singers will be singing is ‘The Beauty of the Earth’. This song is about how we can enjoy our world and all the beautiful things we can find in it.
All of the Middle School Singers meet on day 5 and 8 during flex to practice their songs in the chorus room. Rehearsal kicks off with some vocal warm-ups and transitions to learning/singing the songs.
Some opportunities offered within Middle School Singers are travelling to Hershey Park to perform and compete, meeting special guests that come in, singing in chapel and in school concerts, and performing during school events like the Christmas tree lighting.
