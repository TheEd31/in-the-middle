    <h1>Winter Holidays</h1>
    <h2 class="author">By Ellen Le ('30).</h2>
    <p>
Everyone knows Christmas and New Year’s; they’re the two most popular and celebrated winter holidays. In fact, 85% to 90% of the American population celebrates Christmas, and roughly 60% celebrate New Year’s. But a large number of people choose to celebrate other holidays during the festive season—for instance, Hanukkah or Kwanzaa. Yet, there are non-religious holidays that are recognized in agnostic communities, even those that are celebrated before the general “holiday season”. Below are some winter holidays ( that go deep into all histories and cultures.
    </p>
    <p><strong><i>Dongzhi</i> – China</strong></p>
    <p><strong>  > What?</strong> It celebrates the Winter Solstice (which marks the shortest day and longest night) and the balance of yin and yang.</p>
    <p><strong>  > When?</strong> This year it’s on December 21st.</p>
    <p><strong>  > Food?</strong> Families gather together and share meals of dumplings, tangyuan, and other authentic foods.</p>
    <p><strong><i>Saturnalia</i> - Ancient Rome, Italy</strong></p>
    <p><strong>  > What?</strong> Saturnalia is an Ancient Roman Holiday in honor of their god Saturn (Kronos in Greek mythology).
</p>
    <p><strong>  > When?</strong> It is held on December 17th, originally celebrated for two days. However, by the first century BC, the festival spanned seven days.
</p>
    <p><strong>  > Food?</strong> Ancient Roman cuisine, including feasts of roasted pork, winter vegetables, fruits, cheeses, and wine (...a lot of wine.)</p>
    <p><strong><i>Toji</i> – Japan</strong></p>
    <p><strong>  > What?</strong> Japanese people light bonfires to encourage the sun’s return; huge fires burn on Mount Fuji every year during the longest night.</p>
    <p><strong>  > When?</strong> The Winter Solstice (reference Dongzhi above.)</p>
    <p><strong>  > Food?</strong> A popular food to eat during Toji is the kabocha squash (also known as Japanese pumpkin), as it is thought to bring good luck.</p>
    <p><strong><i>St. Lucia’s Day</i> – Scandinavia</strong></p>
    <p><strong>  > What?</strong> St. Lucia’s Day celebrates St. Lucia of Syracuse, a 4th-century virgin martyr known for bringing food to Christians hiding in Roman catacombs</p>
    <p><strong>  > When?</strong> December 13th.</p>
    <p><strong>  > Food?</strong> Saffron buns (lussekatter) and ginger snaps (pepparkakor) are popular treats, often enjoyed with mulled wine (glögg).</p>
    <p>These are only a small number of the holidays recognized around the world. Many different cultural and ethnic groups have their own unique traditions, and recognizing all of them would take up too many pages in this edition. After all, if you really want to get down to the nitty-gritty of things, a tradition your family holds can be considered a “holiday”, too. Happy winter break!</p>
