    <h1>The MS Cookie Drive</h1>
    <h2 class="author">By Sara Adibi ('31).</h2>
    <p>
The annual Christmas Tree Lighting wouldn’t be the same without the middle school traditional cookie contest leading up to it. When walking around at the Christmas tree lighting event, you can see iced Santa Clauses, delicious snickerdoodles, and festive cookies proudly displayed. Every year, the middle school students have a competition, in which each grade tries to bring in the most cookies to win an ice cream social, a dress-down day, and a pizza party! This year, sixth grade snatched first place with 3,032 cookies; seventh grade trailed behind with 2,778; eighth grade came in last place with 1,613. Together, the middle schoolers accumulated 7,423 cookies, a massive number of cookies to fuel the whole school as they enjoyed the Christmas Tree Lighting.
	In addition to the grade-wide competition, there was a competition for “most festive cookie” as well as “most school spirit cookie”. These competitions, however, were only available to homemade cookies. Henry Rogers ‘31 won “Most Festive Cookie,” and Katie Kossuth won "Most School Spirit.” 
The cookies spread joy across the whole school. Miranda Hampel ‘31 states, “The cookies made the Christmas tree lighting more enjoyable because it brought us all together, and they were so yummy.”
Tess McNeely ‘31 adds, “They were yummy and decorated cute. They made the Christmas tree lighting fun.”
Señora Golden states, “I ate a chocolate chip cookie. It was the best cookie ever! It sparked a lot of joy because it was homemade. I loved viewing all the different cookies!”
The middle school’s annual tradition of baking or buying cookies for the school is one that spreads joy at one of the most anticipated events of the year!
