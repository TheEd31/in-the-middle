    <h1>The Middle School Winter Concert</h1>
    <h2 class="author">By Leo Wang ('30), Zach Chen ('30), and Adam Balogun ('30).</h2>
    <p>
The Winter Concert has been a specialty in the Music Department for a very long time. Since it’s the very first concert that students of the bands and orchestras play in for the whole year, it sets the tone for the rest of that year, making it a magnum opus for those who participate in it. From the start of the year, students participating in any musical aspect have been working tirelessly, rehearsal after rehearsal, practicing every one of their pieces to perfection, all in preparation for this Winter Concert. Then, it all comes to light in December, when the Winter Concert is performed for friends, family, and faculty to all see. Dressed in their ever-fashionable special dress uniforms, the students of the Episcopal Academy are finally able to show the fruits of their labor in the beautiful form of music.
Like it is every year, the Winter Concert is broken up into parts, with the Band playing first and then the Orchestra. This article will specifically highlight the Symphonic Band, Jazz Band, MS Orchestra, and Chamber Ensemble.
This year, the Symphonic Band played 3 songs: Jolly Ol’ St. Stickolas, Candy Cane Clarinets, and It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year. The last one was a combined piece played along with the US Concert Band. The Jazz Band is only playing one selection for this year’s Winter Concert—Ritmo Cristal—featuring two soloists, Zach Chen and Helmut Dang. Still, it’s important to remember that the focus isn’t on the quantity of pieces, but rather the quality.
On the other hand, the Middle School Orchestra is playing 3 songs as well: In the Bleak Midwinter, The 12 Musical Days of Christmas, and, like the Symphonic Band, a combined piece with the US Orchestra; Trepak. With the Jazz Band, the MS Chamber Ensemble performed Good King Wenceslas, Entrance of Queen of Sheba with soloists Yejin Youm and Andrew Huang, and Bring a Torch, Jeanette Isabella, where 6th grader Yejin Youm takes another solo.
The concert this year fell on December 10th, starting at 6:30 PM. If you didn’t have the opportunity to go to the concert this year, don’t worry—there’s always next year, complete with new songs and experiences to look forward to.
