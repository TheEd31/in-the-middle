    <h1>StuCo Game Night</h1>

   On October 24, before the last home football game started, students had the opportunity to participate in the first-ever Student Council-led Game Night. 
Game Night was run and planned by Student Council members, who were each assigned a “room” to ensure everything ran smoothly. Before the event started, StuCo members helped transform their “rooms” to accommodate the activity. At Game Night, there were fun and interactive game stations positioned throughout the first floor of the middle school. Popular music could be heard in the background as students explored all the fun activities. Each game room had a specific theme to enhance the fun experience. The “Test Your Luck” room was a faux casino room filled with card games, such as poker and blackjack, that quite literally tested your luck. Dance lovers could enjoy the “Just Dance” room, in which a screen projected various dance moves that students mirrored. The “Game Rooms” were divided into an interactive, athletic room (that housed ping pong, cornhole, and spikeball) and a stationary “Game Room” (with games like Connect Four, Operation, card games, and giant Jenga.) For video game players, Mario Kart was hosted in Mr. Kerwin’s classroom. Lastly, a competitive BINGO room was set up in Ms. Straub’s room. Overall, numerous classrooms were set up to offer multiple fun activities so that students could enjoy and explore a variety of games.

	Lindsay Ferry, a 7th grader who attended Game Night, states, “I really enjoyed the variety of games. My favorite part personally was the “Just Dance” station. But all of the other games looked really fun too, like Mario Kart.”
	Ms. McGill, faculty advisor to the Student Council, states, “I think game night was a huge success! Students were able to hang out and have a great time playing all kinds of games. My favorite part was the most intense game of giant Jenga I've ever seen! I also loved seeing students get super into spikeball!” Ms. Piette adds, “The variety of activities was perfect—from table tennis and cornhole in the Maple Family Hall to card games led by our eighth-grade student leaders, and classics like Operation!, Apples to Apples, and chess in the breakout space.”
	Game Night was a huge success that will hopefully become an annual tradition for the middle school. As Ms. Piette states, “I would absolutely love to see this continue in upcoming years! The Student Council did an amazing job organizing everything, and it was wonderful to see students enjoying wholesome, interactive fun together. The energy was infectious, and it created such a positive sense of community.”
