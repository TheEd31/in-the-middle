    <h1>Washington D.C.</h1>

   Every year, each grade level of The Episcopal Academy embarks on a school trip that is unique to them. For sixth grade, it’s a fun and engaging trip to Boston, perfect for learning about the start of America. For seventh grade, it’s quite the turnaround in the wilderness at Echo Hill, where students embrace the arms of Mother Nature. However, the 8th grade trip takes you directly to the heart of the United States of America. With tours of landmarks, museums, and even a moon-lit cruise featuring dancing and dinner, the annual trip to Washington, D.C. is certainly one that they won’t forget.

   At 6:30 on Wednesday morning, we gathered at the bus circle with not much time to sleep in (and in uniform, too…). With the rising sun, we hauled our luggage on the bus and headed south. Zooming past roads, forests, and towns and cities that became more and more unfamiliar, we stayed on the road for what felt like forever. Yet, every moment of the drive was filled with friends, laughs, and…yes, phones. Once we arrived, we went straight to lunch at L’Enfant Plaza, a mall bustling with activity and even students from other schools, where we were given a $20 bill for the freedom to purchase the food we wanted. 
After lunch, we headed to the Holocaust Memorial Museum, where we mourned the lives lost to the Nazis, learned of the stories and experiences of those who had their lives changed, and gained insight into the impact religion had during World War II.
Then, we visited our first landmarks, where we were greeted with a stunning view of the Washington Monument from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. There we witnessed a curious detail in the Lincoln Memorial: a typo at the monument, where the engravers carved “euture” instead of “future”. Most of us found this quite hilarious, and one of our teachers even promised a bag of Mike-and-Ikes to whoever found the error first. We also visited the Vietnam War Memorial, reading soldiers’ names on black stone and observing life-like statues just next to them, marching through the rice paddies of Vietnam in drenched rain jackets.

      A 30-minute ride to Mount Vernon brought us to the home and burial site of George Washington. Walking through the restoration of his house, we were able to appreciate Washington’s taste in architecture, and maybe not-so-great taste in color, with a room being painted bright green for no apparent reason. We also visited the backyard of the red-roofed house, bathing in the afternoon light hitting the Potomac River and drinking in the relaxing view of the breezy waters.
Following another half hour on the bus, we finally arrived at our hotel, where we checked into our rooms and changed into casual clothes for the night. Gathering together in the lobby, we then hopped back onto the buses and headed to what many looked forward to that night: dinner at Pinstripes. Afterwards, we all rushed down to the bowling alleys where we were able to spend the night bowling and playing bocce. We kept these activities up until 9:15, when we returned to the buses and drove back to the hotel. Once we got back, we returned to our rooms with our newfound roommates, and then had our phones taken away at 10.

A wake-up call at 6am on Thursday brought us down to breakfast, after which we departed for Capitol Hill. Shortly after arriving there, we met with an EA graduate who worked as a banking assistant for Senator McCormick. She explained to us how the Capitol Building operated, answered many of our questions, and provided her own experience with the government. Afterwards, we took the traditional panoramic class picture in front of the US Capitol Building despite the eye-watering winds that day. Following that, we visited the National Cathedral, which was truly a sight to behold. With over 300 feet in height of Gothic stone architecture, it was truly a marvel of a landmark. The interior was no less astonishing, with hundreds of stained glass windows and massive designs all hand-carved. Lunch was held at the Pentagon City Mall that day, where we were once more given $20 for the variety of food and treats at the mall, with some of us even purchasing some souvenirs.
At 2, we departed for Arlington National Cemetery, where we visited the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier where we witnessed the Changing of the Guards. Then, perhaps the most memorable of the entire trip (second only to the cruise) was when four members of the 8th grade formally laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Ellen Le, Ella Diaz, Graham Evans, and Alex Patitucci held the full honor of this unforgettable moment and later received U.S. Army Challenge Coins that could be used for both bragging rights and catching other members off guard. If a coin was shown to another who should have a coin, and the other person didn’t show theirs, then they now owed the original individual a soda—a fun twist for such an honorable item.
And, finally, after changing into dresses and polos…the famed dinner and dance cruise. Group pictures were taken at the dock, and we set sail at sunset on the Potomac. The booming music was blasting at full volume, and we danced all our energy out as we pushed 100 decibels on the ship. On the chilly upper decks, we watched planes land at Reagan National Airport and snapped pictures of both sides of the river. It was truly what it was hyped up to be.

      On the last day of the trip, we packed up our bags and checked out of the hotel on Friday morning. Our first stop was the World War II Memorial, where a ring of pillars dedicated to each state that contributed to the effort surrounded a beautiful fountain of water. Then, with the chilly wind piercing through our coats, we visited the towering MLK Jr. memorial: a massive stone monument cut out of a mountain of stone, carved into the shape of Martin Luther King Jr. Traveling along a calming lake-side, we also visited the FDR Memorial, gaining more knowledge about America during the Civil Rights Movement and the Great Depression.
Afterwards, we indulged in pasta and parmigiana as a farewell lunch at Carmine’s Italian Restaurant. Delicious take-home cookies were handed out, the priceless Challenge Coins were given, and at long last, we were headed home.
On the way back, some slept, some listened to music, and others still flocked back to their electronics. Though all of our experiences were unique, the trip to D.C. was filled with laughter, memories, and unforgettable moments.
If only our May Term were as predictable.
Guess we’ll have to find out.
