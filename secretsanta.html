    <h1>Secret Santa Gift Ideas</h1>
    <h2 class="author">By Ellen Le ('30), and Leo Wang ('30).</h2>
    <p>
Since the first giving in 1979, Secret Santa has cemented itself as a well-loved tradition around the world, bringing joy to the holiday season. For those unfamiliar with the tradition, group members are assigned another member to anonymously (hence the “Secret”) buy a gift (hence the “Santa”) for, based on the budget provided. It’s set up to be a fun way to celebrate the holidays with friends at a low cost.
The most popular budgets are generally between $20 and $30, but some groups will set theirs upwards of $100. Popular gift ideas can range anywhere from office stationery to motorcycle helmets, depending on the wishlist and the giver. Based on what’s trending these days, here’s a list of gifts that can suit anyone:   
    </p>
    <p>1. - <strong>Fuzzy Socks.</strong> Winter gets cold around these parts, and scientifically feet play a large role in the general warmth of the human body. If they’re festive, that’s even better!</p>
    <p>2. - <strong>Crochet/Knitting Kits.</strong> The holidays are a wonderful time to learn something new, and making a scarf can both keep your recipient warm and find them a new obsession. </p>
    <p>3. - <strong>Gift Cards.</strong> Starbucks, Amazon, Target, you name it. Giving your recipient the freedom to get himself or herself anything is arguably the best last resort, especially if he or she is not someone you’re very familiar with.</p>
    <p>4. - <strong>Food.</strong> From hot chocolate packets to sugar-packed candy, there are many ways you can make your recipient happy with the simple joy of filling your belly.</p>
    <p>5. - <strong>Makeup.</strong> For the girlies. What else can I say?</p>
    <p>6. - <strong>Mini Toaster Lamp.</strong> You never know. It’s certainly on your editor-in-chief’s wish list.</p>
    <p>7. - <strong>Books.</strong> A super popular yet simple and effective classic. Thousands of different options and genres that are a perfect gift for anyone to get lost in.</p>
    <p>8. - <strong>Coffee Mugs.</strong> They’re an adorable yet useful gift that’s also customizable. You can stick on cute pictures and messages, giving it just that little extra love.</p>
    <p>9. - <strong>Candles.</strong> Even if it’s a seemingly useless gift, candles can actually both be very useful and very decorative. They provide light in the times of darkness, and just add that holiday spirit to any household.</p>
    <p>10. - <strong>A LEGO set.</strong> No matter what anyone says, building one is never boring; you just have to find the time for it. Once you get your hands on them, you can’t stop, and with the two weeks of winter break you don’t have to.</p>
    <p>11. - <strong>Board Games.</strong> Literally the definition of togetherness, board games are an infinite possibility of fun, laughing and a lot of chaos. A perfect gift for anyone.</p>
    <p>12. - <strong>Fidget Toys.</strong> Although they might be slightly off trend these days, fidget toys can still be fun to use and play around with. Combined with their cheap price and limitless variety, there’s a lot of potential.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day (or more like year!), if Secret Santa gift-giving isn’t up your alley, you can always wait for the real Santa to come along and give you your own special present. Happy Holidays!</p>
