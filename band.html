    <h1>Symphonic Band</h1>
    <h2 class="author">By Leo ('30) and Adam ('30)</h2>

At the start of the 7th grade, one of the most important aspects of EA comes into play: the electives. With a variety of electives spanning subjects like STEM and marine biology, there is a near-endless selection of fun and intriguing electives to take and enjoy. However, there are still some requirements students must fulfill for these electives: taking at least one theatre elective, such as Designing for the Stage and Improv, and one music elective, such as Guitar 101 and Handbells. Another option for students is taking a year-long music course, such as the famed Symphonic Band. Playing catchy songs like <i>All I Want for Christmas Is You</i>, the Symphonic Band is a staple example of the EA music department. The man behind the class is Mr. Dankanich, who lets you play instruments such as the trumpet, baritone, saxophone, clarinet, flutes, trombones, and percussion all year long. Due to it spanning across the entire school year, we can choose which songs we want to play in accordance with the season, like in the Winter, we play Christmas-themed songs like <i>Santa the Barbarian</i>. This year, the Symphonic Band is playing 4 pieces, still featuring that classic Christmas theme: <i>Candy Cane Clarinets</i>, <i>Jolly Ol’ Saint Stickolas</i>, <i>A Glorious Noel</i>, and <i>A Bleak Midwinter</i>, which will all be featured during the Winter Concert on December 10th. Mr. Dankanich also offers Jazz Band, letting students play different types of jazz music, such as the songs <i>Ritmo Cristal</i> and <i>Flight of the Foo Birds</i>. In the Symphonic band, you also take a trip to Hershey Park for the Music in the Parks event, a real highlight of the experience, where you compete against other schools to earn awards with distinguished honor, with the rankings being Superior, Excellent, and Good. After we compete, we go straight to the rides, where we have about an hour to go on roller coasters, have fun with our friends, and overall have a blast at Hershey. So, if playing an instrument has any appeal to you, or maybe you just want to feel the beat, give Symphonic Band a try.
