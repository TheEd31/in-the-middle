    <h1>Echo Hill</h1>

    <p>
   On Wednesday, October 14th, the seventh-grade class departed for Echo Hill, located in Maryland on the southern side of the Chesapeake Bay. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the Echo Hill staff and shown to our cabins. The cabins, filled with bunk beds, held room for eight students. After dropping off our belongings in our cabins, we started our orientation session, where we learned about our schedule and general important information for our trip.
    </p>
    <p>
   After orientation, we headed over to lunch and learned about the tradition of the slop bucket and our gratitude circle. The slop bucket is a bucket in which we pile our table’s food waste and ultimately measure how much food we wasted. This simple task taught us an important lesson about not wasting food and being grateful for what we have. Before every meal, we gathered in a circle, where people could share gratitude to staff members, friends, or teachers. On the first day after measuring our food waste, we were informed about our walking groups, our activities, and the necessary items for each activity. 
One such activity was Pathfinders, which was centered on team bonding with our walking group, comfort in the outdoors, and building communication skills. At the end of our first activity, we were given “passports”—a small booklet in which we reflected on the lessons we learned from our various activities. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Other activities offered included Seeds and Weeds, which taught students about different aspects of plants; Garbology, where students examined garbage; Bay Studies, which taught students about the ecology of the Chesapeake Bay by finding and observing fish and crabs; Aquatic Studies, where students caught fish in different areas; Survival, which was a class focused on survival strategies in the wilderness; and Ziplining, which was a fun course built around team bonding. After three hours of partaking in our respective activities, we all had time to enjoy an hour of free time, where we could shower, go down to the beach, gather with our friends at tentside, or explore the campside.
