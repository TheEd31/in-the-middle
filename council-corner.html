   The new student council members have been elected!! New council members include Remy Meininger, Arden Cha, Nicholas Bailey, and Logan Wright from 6th grade; Ishaan Wani and Tess McNeely from 7th grade; Dev Patel, Elise Markle, and Maya Rajan from 8th grade. All new members have done and will do a great job and bring important ideas to meetings. Already, we have had a great start to the year, with events like Game Night, the Halloween Costume Contest, and Are You Smarter Than a Middle Schooler!! The categories that students were able to compete in for the Costume Contest were silliest, spookiest, and most creative. Ben Shane won silliest, most creative went to Alex Lo, and silliest went to Harry Rheam. This year, there was a new category decided by the students: Fan favorite, won by Arden Cha as a Labubu. This was chosen for the person who got the most applause for their costume. An upcoming StuCo event is In the Middle, which is a StuCo-run fifth-grade shadow day. Also, the Spirit Week daily themes are picked by StuCo as well!! This year’s themes are Jersey Day, Seasons Day, Clash Day, and the classical and traditional Blue and White Day.

    MS Chapel Council sees many of its big events in the first third of the school year. Three more members from each grade were officially added to this year’s roster. From 6th grade: Isabella Fiedler, Ryan Shane, and Glory Wilson; from 7th grade: Lydia Aller, Bailey Mercedat, and Christian Cloud; and from 8th grade: Alma Vennera, Ella Christie, and Ryan Burke. The President and Vice President of Chapel Council have also been chosen: President Riley Romanczuk and Vice President Katie Esterhai are excited to lead the council this year!
Along with elections, the annual blessing of the animals took place in St. Francis Chapel, where students and staff had the opportunity to bring in their pets to Chapel; anything from dogs to fish to even a rat were welcomed before the altar!
The annual Can Drive also kicked off recently with a skit performed by Chapel Council. This year, 6th grade partners with Memorial Church of God in Christ, 7th grade with St. James School, and 8th grade with ACLAMO. As a new change this year, “I donated” stickers will be given out to those who bring in items; as always, 100% participation is heavily encouraged! 
Though a trimester of the school year hasn’t passed yet, Chapel Council forever bustles with activity and will continue to do so throughout the year!

      Make sure to keep an eye out for more fun and exciting events happening throughout the year!!
