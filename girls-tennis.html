    <h1>MS Girls Tennis</h1>
    <h2 class="author">By Campbell ('32), Grace ('32), and Ava ('32).</h2>
    <p>
Tennis is like a cycle: you serve, you struggle, you adapt, you strive, and you sometimes lose, but you always come back for the next point. Middle school girls' tennis is a great opportunity to get involved and try something new. Players can cheer on their teammates, work hard, and have fun at the same time.
	 The middle school girls' tennis program consists of three teams: A, B, and C teams. The A and B teams have played matches against other schools. They have succeeded in many matches, sometimes losing, but always repeating that cycle: serve, struggle, adapt, strive, and sometimes lose. There are so many important things in tennis: footwork, your swing, and even where you stand on the court. However, the most important part about tennis is trying again and coming back.
The coaches for tennis have devoted their time to helping us succeed. The coaches this year were: Coach Whalen, Ms. McGill, Ms. Montgomery, Ms. Dragwa, Ms. Yeager, and Ms. Fu.

<h2>
  【 Q&A with an MS Girls Tennis Coach 】
    </h2>
    <p>
Q. What is your favorite thing about coaching tennis
I like that the group is very small so I get to know the players better. We have beautiful facilities, I love spending time out on the courts!


Q. How long have you been coaching tennis
I have been coaching for 5 full years and the first 3 I coached C team and then I coached A team.


Q. What is your least favorite thing about coaching tennis 
 I don’t like the long bus rides/drives to matches. I also don’t like the cold and when it gets very windy.


Q. Have you seen improvement from players this year
Yes, I have seen tons of improvement especially from the 8th graders over the years.


Can you tell me about your coaching experience and background in tennis?
 Before I came to EA I had no coaching experience, but I watched a lot of tennis.





What inspired you to become a tennis coach?
I coached Boys soccer first but it was not my favorite and I was not very interested. I liked and had more interest in tennis so I switched and I learned so much from the players
What do you believe are the most important  skills for players to master?
I believe that hustle is very important. There are moments to relax and slow down but there are also times you must show commitment. 


How do you balance technical instruction with keeping tennis fun and engaging?


We like to integrate important practice into fun games and drills.


How do you handle different player personalities or learning styles?
Working with singles is easier because you are coaching them directly while it is harder to coach doubles because they must be evenly matched and work well together.
